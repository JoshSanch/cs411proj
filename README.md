## Backend Requirements
Some packages may need to be installed via apt, including:
```
libmysqlclient-dev
python3-dev
```

Make sure to install Python dependencies to resolve most errors by running the following command from inside the backend folder:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### For OS X Users:
It is likely that you will run into an error message when installing MySQLClient. In order to fix this issue, please refer to this guide [here](https://ruddra.com/install-mysqlclient-macos/)
